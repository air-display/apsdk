# About fairplay
This project includes a submodule named [fairplay](https://github.com/air-display/fairplay) located in [third-party\fairplay](third-party\fairplay). Because the [fairplay](https://github.com/air-display/fairplay) project is currently private, if you perform submodule updating, you will get permission errors. Actually you can build apsdk project without this submodule (obviously it will not work because apsdk will use empty implementation).
